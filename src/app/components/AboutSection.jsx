        <p className="text-ash">Hi again — I’m Shama, a Bangalore-based designer blending UI, UX, and visual storytelling into digital art.

I studied design because I love understanding people. I stayed because I want to make the internet feel more human, warm, and expressive.

👩‍💻 I design, animate, and obsess over pixels.  
🎨 I also sketch ideas on paper, walls, or sometimes — my own jeans.  
🌏 I’m inspired by retro signage, Brutalist architecture, and lo-fi music.
